üéØ COLON SYNTAX FEATURE DEMONSTRATION
=====================================

The new colon syntax allows selective command execution for projects:

üìã SYNTAX:
  workon <project>              # Execute all configured commands  
  workon <project>:<command>    # Execute single command
  workon <project>:<cmd1,cmd2>  # Execute multiple commands
  workon <project>:help         # Show available commands

‚ú® KEY FEATURES:
  
  1. BACKWARD COMPATIBLE
     workon my-project          # Still works exactly as before
  
  2. SELECTIVE EXECUTION  
     workon my-project:cwd      # Just change directory
     workon my-project:claude   # Just open Claude
     
  3. SMART DEPENDENCIES
     workon my-project:claude   # Auto-adds 'cwd' dependency
     workon my-project:npm      # Auto-adds 'cwd' dependency
     
  4. MULTIPLE COMMANDS
     workon my-project:cwd,claude,npm    # Custom combinations
     
  5. PROJECT HELP
     workon my-project:help     # Show what commands are available
     
  6. ERROR VALIDATION
     workon my-project:invalid  # Clear error messages
     
  7. SHELL MODE SUPPORT
     workon my-project:cwd --shell       # Works with all flags

üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS:

  ‚Ä¢ Zero switchit changes needed - uses existing parameter parsing
  ‚Ä¢ Simple string split logic: project.split(':')  
  ‚Ä¢ Integrates perfectly with Command-Centric Architecture
  ‚Ä¢ Smart layout detection works with any command combination
  ‚Ä¢ Comprehensive validation and dependency resolution

üéâ BENEFITS:

  ‚Ä¢ Faster startup for individual commands
  ‚Ä¢ Flexible workflow matching  
  ‚Ä¢ Resource efficiency
  ‚Ä¢ Better testing and debugging
  ‚Ä¢ Foundation for future features (aliases, profiles, etc.)

This feature transforms workon from "all-or-nothing" to "pick-what-you-need"!
